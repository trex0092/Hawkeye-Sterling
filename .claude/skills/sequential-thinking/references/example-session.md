# Example Session: "What is the optimal strategy for a 3-player auction?"

## Thought 1 — Initial framing

```
💭 Thought 1/5
First, I need to clarify what type of auction we're dealing with.
Common types: English (ascending), Dutch (descending), sealed-bid
first-price, sealed-bid second-price (Vickrey). The optimal strategy
differs significantly by type. I'll assume a sealed-bid first-price
auction unless told otherwise.
[1/5] history=1 next=true
```

## Thought 2 — Core analysis

```
💭 Thought 2/5
In a sealed-bid first-price auction with 3 players and independent
private values uniformly distributed on [0,1], the symmetric Bayesian
Nash equilibrium bidding strategy is b(v) = v * (n-1)/n = v * 2/3.
Each player shades their bid below their true valuation.
[2/5] history=2 next=true
```

## Thought 3 — Revision of thought 1

```
🔄 Revision 3/5 (revising thought 1)
Wait — I assumed sealed-bid first-price, but the question says
"auction" generically. I should cover the dominant strategy for
the most common types rather than assuming one. This changes my
approach: I need to address multiple formats.
[3/5] history=3 next=true
```

## Thought 4 — Branching to explore Vickrey auction

`totalThoughts` adjusted upward from 5 to 7 because the revision revealed more ground to cover.

```
🌿 Branch 4/7 (from thought 2, ID: vickrey)
In a Vickrey (second-price sealed-bid) auction, the dominant strategy
is to bid your true valuation regardless of the number of players.
With 3 players, each bids v. The winner pays the second-highest bid.
This is strategy-proof: no player benefits from deviating.
[4/7] history=4 branches=vickrey next=true
```

## Thought 5 — Branching to explore English auction

```
🌿 Branch 5/7 (from thought 2, ID: english)
In an English (ascending) auction with 3 players, the dominant
strategy is to stay in the bidding until the price reaches your
valuation, then drop out. The winner is the last remaining bidder,
paying just above the second-highest valuation. Strategically
equivalent to the Vickrey auction.
[5/7] history=5 branches=vickrey,english next=true
```

## Thought 6 — Hypothesis generation

```
💭 Thought 6/7
Hypothesis: The optimal strategy depends entirely on auction format.
For 3 players: First-price sealed → bid 2/3 of value.
Vickrey/English → bid true value. Dutch → equivalent to first-price.
Let me verify this against the revenue equivalence theorem before
concluding.
[6/7] history=6 branches=vickrey,english next=true
```

## Thought 7 — Verification and final answer

```
💭 Thought 7/7
Verification: Revenue equivalence theorem confirms all four standard
auction formats yield the same expected revenue under symmetric
independent private values. The strategies:

• First-price sealed / Dutch: bid (n-1)/n × value = 2/3v
• Second-price sealed / English: bid true value = v

Both are equilibrium strategies. The 3-player case doesn't introduce
special considerations beyond the general n-player formulas.
Final answer confirmed.
[7/7] history=7 branches=vickrey,english next=false
```

## Key Features Demonstrated

- **Dynamic depth**: Started at 5, expanded to 7 when scope grew
- **Revision**: Thought 3 reconsidered the assumption made in thought 1
- **Branching**: Thoughts 4 and 5 explored alternative auction types from thought 2
- **Hypothesis + verification**: Thought 6 proposed, thought 7 verified
- **Clean termination**: `nextThoughtNeeded: false` only after confident answer
